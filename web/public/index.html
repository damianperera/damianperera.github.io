                  I had the pleasure to work with Damian for over a year at Personio. During this time Damian has proven
                  to be a very reliable, friendly, team-oriented engineer, always showing a high degree of integrity and
                  ownership. His technical skills not only helped the team but also me to understand the caveats and
                  bottlenecks of our complex monolith-migration project and take proper decision right on time.
                  <br /><br />It's important to mention that Damian not only shows great technical and social abilities
                  but also has a fantastic product awareness, always being a reliable peer in our cross-functional team.
                  Due to a massive department growth and an urging need for his skills in another team, we're currently
                  not working together but I'm truly looking forward to have the chance to work with Damian again.
                  <br /><br />Damian is a great addition to any team and I have no doubts I'll hear about uncountable
                  success cases throughout his career as a software engineer.

                  understand the customer's problems as well the product requirements. He supports the onboarding of new
                  colleagues, and with his good mood and openness, he increases the team's happiness.
                  Mostly I am impressed with Damian's architectural and planning abilities. He supported me
                  significantly with a complex roadmap planning of a technical re-architecture of our domain and made
                  sure that all technical aspects and potential risks are considered before and during this complex

                  stressful situations.
                  <br /><br />While Damian was in my team I could rest easy knowing that he would be at the forefront of
                  any issue that would come up, generally with a solution in place before it even gets to me. Aside from
                  his on-point work ethic, he is also a pleasure to work with. Damian is often the life of the party and
                  he demonstrates a passion for drawing the team together and motivating them.
                  <br /><br />I highly recommend Damian to any team that has a good vision for the future, if he buys

                  our day-to-day operations.

                  Damian is one of the most exceptional characters I have met in my career. He takes pride in every
                  aspect he's doing. He's quite an example for a true full-stack engineer, where he technically excels
                  at every task he's given with. His knowledge on Javascript is top-notch where he has made a lot of
                  contributions to our team as well as the open source community. What I like the most about him, is his
                  curiosity to learn new technologies, evaluate them and quickly adapt into them. He's the kind of
                  engineer who goes above and beyond his assigned responsibilities, to help his project and his team
                  mates whenever needed.
                  <br /><br /> He's also a great team player and a people's person with a solid personality, which
                  indeed makes him adapt to any working environment he's put into. He possesses great leadership skills
                  which will indeed be an inspiration to everyone working around him. He's a young and talented
                  engineer, and he would definitely be an invaluable asset to any team.

                  Damian worked with me in 2019 during my time as engineering lead for Sysco LABS' customer experience
                  organization. He was one of the more exceptional software engineers in that team: technically solid,
                  hardworking and possessing soft skills necessary for future leadership. One of the things he did was
                  taking ownership of a relatively complicated architectural change that helped improve the
                  application's front-end performance significantly.
                  <br /><br />He'll be a great addition to any team.

                  Damian was the youngest in my team and a fine gentleman. He had the challenge to replace the skill set
                  of a senior engineer. Undoubtedly he accomplished that challenge. That was his very first time working
                  in front-end technology. Within a short period, he groomed himself as a well-experienced engineer. He
                  posses strong skills in JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS and AWS. Also, he is skilled in Java.
                  <br /><br />He is a strong communicator. He delivers concepts clearly to different levels of
                  audiences. He blends well with teammates, which makes him a required person all the time. His
                  well-organized work structure helps stakeholders to get a clear picture of how things getting done. He
                  is a go-getter. His friendly behaviour is a great asset to the team.
                  <br /><br />I highly recommend this wonderful young gentleman without a second thought.
